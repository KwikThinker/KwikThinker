KwikThinker
===========

Android app for HackRPI.

<i>KwikThinker</i> won <b>"Best Minimalistic App"</b> as well as the <b>IBM BlueMix API awards</b> at the hackathon.

A fast-paced quiz game in which you have a short amount of time to read each statement and decide whether it's true or false. Currently available on Android devices.

Check it out: you can download the <code>apk</code> [right here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css7209/Resources/Android/KwikThinker00.apk).
